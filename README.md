# Spatial Transcriptomics of Mouse Brain Development and Aging

This repository contains the analysis code for the manuscript:

**"Spatial Transcriptomics Reveals Regional and Temporal Dynamics of Gene Expression in the Mouse Brain Across Development and Aging"**

## üß† Overview

This project investigates region-specific gene expression changes across brain development and aging in mice using spatial transcriptomics. We focus on transcriptional dynamics across key brain regions including the hippocampus, cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, and striatum, leveraging the 10x Genomics Visium platform.

Key findings highlight:
- **Neurogenesis, gliogenesis, and myelination** during development.
- **Neuroinflammation and glial activation** during aging.
- Distinct transcriptomic patterns in hippocampal subregions (DG, CA1-2, CA3, matrix).

## üìä Analysis Pipeline

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Spot filtering (<250 genes, <500 UMIs removed)
   - CPM normalization and scaling
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - PCA and Harmony for batch correction
   - UMAP visualization
3. **Clustering**:
   - SNN graph, resolution 0.075
   - Anatomical region annotation based on Allen Brain Atlas
4. **Differential Expression Analysis**:
   - DEGs identified with Wilcoxon Rank Sum test
   - GO enrichment via **clusterProfiler**
5. **Hippocampal Subregion Analysis**:
   - Subclustering into DG, CA1-2, CA3, Matrix
   - Trend analysis across P21 ‚Üí Adult ‚Üí Aged
